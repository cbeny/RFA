# Relevant Feature Analysis

This is an example of implementation of the approach presented in https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.10387

This program trains and tests a neural network for the classification of MNIST digits using a novel loss function, coupled with an extra post-processing operation.

The algorithm converges very fast, and has a strong regularizing effect.

This code can be straighforwardly extended to learn to do inference between two correlated datasets.
